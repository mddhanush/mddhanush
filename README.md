### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Dhanush MD!

---

An enthusiastic Electrical and Electronics Engineer with a passion for turning ideas into reality through technology. My journey in the realm of electronics has equipped me with a diverse skill set.

ðŸ”§ As an engineer, I specialize in various aspects of the field, including VLSI design, Embedded Systems, and Arduino development. Whether it's crafting intricate circuits, optimizing systems for efficiency, or creating innovative solutions, I thrive on challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible.

ðŸ’» My coding repertoire extends across several languages, from the web trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the robust foundations of C++ and Python. I believe in the power of programming to transform concepts into functional and scalable solutions.

Let's connect and build the future together! ðŸš€âœ¨
