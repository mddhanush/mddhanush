---

An enthusiastic Electrical and Electronics Engineer with a passion for turning ideas into reality through technology. My journey in the realm of electronics has equipped me with a diverse skill set.

🔧 As an engineer, I specialize in various aspects of the field, including VLSI design, Embedded Systems, and Arduino development. Whether it's crafting intricate circuits, optimizing systems for efficiency, or creating innovative solutions, I thrive on challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible.

💻 My coding repertoire extends across several languages, from the web trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the robust foundations of C++ and Python. I believe in the power of programming to transform concepts into functional and scalable solutions.

Let's connect and build the future together! 🚀✨
